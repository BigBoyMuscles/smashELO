# Overview
This is a hastily put together tool for calculating a player's rank for SMA tournaments. If you don't know what SMA is, this is probably of no interest to you. Currently the tool requires that each match be hard-coded in because it is intended only to estimate current player rankings based on past match history. The full tool will be developed for the full SMA web-app.

Final rank following each tournament is output in CSV format, with Total Games played, Total Wins, and Total Losses for each palyer for easy creation of a spreadsheet. 

This tool should probably never be used by anyone else because it is poorly made and practically useless.
